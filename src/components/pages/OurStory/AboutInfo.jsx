        Drawing inspiration from her travels in Asia, Europe and the USA. The
        well traveled designer names Japan and Hong Kong as two of her favourite
        destinations. I love relaxed silhouettes, cuts and use of drapery that
        takes cue from Japanese fashion masters. She designs for women of
        strength and sophisticated femininity. Yoke creates signature pieces
        that donâ€™t care for seasons and become keepers for life.

        Yoke embraces the fierce independence in all of us, creating a realm of
        quality and confidence for the modern on-trend woman.
